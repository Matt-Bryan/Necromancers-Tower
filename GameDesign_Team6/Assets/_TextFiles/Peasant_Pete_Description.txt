Pete travels through the tower seeking vengance against the necromancer who kidnapped his prized poultry.

With his offensive powers, he easily defeats the monsters that wish him harm (and the monsters who just kind of get in the way on accident).

Pete's abilities lend themselves well to a faster-paced, offensive playing style.
